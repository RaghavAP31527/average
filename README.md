📝 `calculate_average(numbers)` is a function that calculates the average of a list of numbers.

🧮 Inside the function:
   - 📏 It checks if the list is empty using `len(numbers) == 0`.
   - 🛑 If the list is empty, it returns an error message "The list is empty, cannot calculate the average."
   - ➕ Otherwise, it calculates the sum of the numbers using `total = sum(numbers)`.
   - ➗ Then, it calculates the average by dividing the total by the number of elements in the list using `average = total / len(numbers)`.

📊 Example usage:
   - 📋 `number_list` is a sample list of numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
   - 📝 The `calculate_average` function is called with `number_list` as an argument.
   - 🖨️ It prints the average with a formatted message using `print(f"The average is: {result}")`.

You can replace `number_list` with your own list of numbers to calculate the average for your specific data. 🧮📊🖨️
